# Breast-Cancer-prediction-using-data-analysis-in-python
In this notebook,  Breast cancer is classified as malignant or benign based on features of breast tumour cells extracted from the dataset. 
SVC model is used to evaluate and train the model. Also normalizing and scaling techniques are used to improve the efficiency of the model by cleaning and normalizing the data set.
Grid Search CV is used to prevent overfitting and underfitting of the model and optimise its efficiency and remove type-2 errors in the model which can be life threatening for the patient.
